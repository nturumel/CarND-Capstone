# CarND-Capstone
This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

## Setting up:
You have the three options for setting up this project: Virtual Machine, Native Installation and docker. 
If you are running a windows machine like me, I would recommend using docker. Windows wsl2 (Windows Subsytem Linux) has tight integration with Docker Desktop which makes for a delightful development experience. 
I will be going over how I used docker to get started. If you want to use any of the other two options, please refer [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/blob/master/README.md).

### Steps:
1. Get [wsl2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) on your windows machine.
2. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
3. Although not necessary, I would highly recommend getting [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and installing the [docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and [remote development extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). This would allow you to explore subystem directories, launch containers, mount directories and do a lot more right from your code editor.
4. Get the [code](https://github.com/nturumel/CarND-Capstone) and the [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).
5. Open wsl2 bash terminal.
6. Run: 
```bash 
    docker pull redherring2141/carnd-capstone
```
 to get the docker necessary image.

7. `cd` into the project directory. 
8.  Run  (might want to create a script for this):
```bash
    docker run -p 4567:4567 -v {pwd}:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/  --name={container_name} --rm -it    redherring2141/carnd-capstone:latest
```
9. If you want to set up another terminal, simply run:
```bash
    docker exec -it <container name>
    source /root/ros_entrypoint.sh 
 ```
11.  `cd` into the ros directory of the container and run the following to launch the project:
```bash
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.sh
    roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
12.  Start the simulator, turn off *manual* and start the *camera*.

## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to get a car to successfully navigate itself around a predefined path. There are two programmable modules at play, the behavior planner and the perception module. Since the path has already been laid out, we do not have a trajectory planner. The trajectory data comes in the form of a list of waypoints instead.

The raw camera feed is analyzed by the perception, which scans for traffic lights, road signs or any other obstacles in the vehicle's path. The data generated by perception is read by the behavior planner, which picks the appropriate action for the car, i.e. whether it should accerlerate, decelerate or stop.   

The behavior planner for this project only decides what the next set of waypoints for the car should be, and what the approaching velocity for those waypoints should be. The car is equipped with the **drive by wire** feature, which acts as the control module. It reads in the data communicated by the behavior module and performs the actual driving.

There are two tracks in the simulator.
* A highway test track with traffic lights.
* A testing lot test track.

For those enrolled in the Udacity self-driving nanodegree, there is an opportunity to have your code drive on Carla (Udacity's very own self driving car). The testing lot track is set up resemble the environment that Carla will be tested under.
